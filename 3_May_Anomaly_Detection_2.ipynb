        "###The role of feature selection in anomaly detection is to identify the subset of features that are most relevant to the detection of anomalies, while discarding or ignoring the irrelevant or redundant features. This can be beneficial in several ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Improved performance: By focusing only on the most informative features, the anomaly detection algorithm can achieve better performance, as the irrelevant features can add noise and confusion to the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Reduced computational cost: The process of anomaly detection can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data. By reducing the number of features to be analyzed, feature selection can help to reduce the computational cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Better interpretability: By selecting only the most relevant features, it can be easier to interpret the results of the anomaly detection algorithm, as the focus is on the most important aspects of the data.\n",

        "###There are several methods for feature selection in anomaly detection, including correlation analysis, statistical tests, and machine learning-based methods such as recursive feature elimination and Lasso regularization. The choice of method depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis."

The algorithm starts by selecting a random data point and finding all the neighboring points within a specified distance (eps). If there are enough points within this distance (min_samples), the algorithm considers them as part of the same cluster. It then recursively finds the neighboring points of each point in the cluster and adds them to the same cluster until there are no more points within the distance eps.\n",
